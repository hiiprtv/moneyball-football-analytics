# Moneyball Football Analytics

## Project Overview:

Moneyball Football Analytics is a data-driven scouting tool designed to identify undervalued football players across Europe’s Top 5 leagues using performance-to-salary ratios and machine learning techniques.
The goal is to replicate a Moneyball-style approach to football recruitment—finding high-impact players who deliver strong on-field performance relative to their market value.

This project is aimed at supporting clubs, analysts, and scouts in making objective, data-backed transfer decisions.

 ## Objectives:
